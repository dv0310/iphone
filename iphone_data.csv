"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."

"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"

"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."

"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."

"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."
"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."

"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"

"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"".

Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."

"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."
"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."

"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"

"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it.

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it.

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."
"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."

"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"

"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it.

"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.

"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."
"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."

"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"

The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it.

"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."

"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."
"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it.

After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."

"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."

"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on .

"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."

"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."

This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card.

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.

The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.

"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"

It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card.

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it.

I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"

"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."

"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%.

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."

It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%).

I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card.

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."

"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"

"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"".

The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."
"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."

"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"

"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."

"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."
"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."

"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"

"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it.

"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.

"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."
"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."

"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"

The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it.

"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."

"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."
"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it.

After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."

"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."

"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on .

"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."

"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."

This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card.

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.

The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.

"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"

It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card.

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it.

I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"

"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."

"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%.

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."

It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%).

I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card.

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."

"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"

"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"".

The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."
"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."

"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"

"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."

"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."

The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"

"the phone is great!! excellent for the price, came with 86% battery capacity and runs super smoothly! only thing i can say, is that the screen has been replaced by a non genuine apple screen, and it doesn’t really cause major issues, but sometimes when i try to type or click something, i have to do it more than once. not a big deal though if you don’t care about those types of things."
"It was important to me to buy a refurbished phone, as I care about the environmental impact of replacing electronics.  I've had a mixed experience with the Amazon program.  This phone arrived looking and functioning as if brand new, but the charger cord was clearly a cheap off-brand, and the wall adaptor was damaged so that the USB could not plug in.  We have plenty of chargers at home, but this does not inspire confidence in the quality of the product itself.  Because they come with limited warranties, I worry about purchasing from a company that clearly does such limited quality control.  Do better, Amazon, if you want to make a real impact on sustainability, insist that the companies you work with provide quality products and experiences."
"Just upgraded my XR to an 11 because my current phone was falling apart lol. I’m the type of person to keep my cell phone for as long as humanly possible, so whenever I end up purchasing a new phone, it’s usually an older model. The phone itself works amazingly, and I’m not having any problems with it so far thank God! However, be warned— I just opened/set up my phone today, and the the battery health is at 76%. The product description clearly states that the phone will be sold to the customer with a MINIMUM of 80% battery health, which sucks because although my iPhone XR was (quite literally) falling apart, the battery health was still at 82% after 3 years of owning it. I will update this review if I end up having issues with the battery, and if all else fails, will send the phone back for a replacement within the 90-day time period if the battery health shows itself to be a dilemma towards me.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase at the present!"
"This phone is amazing!! I was a little skeptical but it’s totally worth it!! The battery is good and mine came with an 87% batter health! There is a small scratch on the screen which is noticeable but it doesn’t look bother me. Camera is great! Honestly the only thing I have to say is only half of the speakers work but it’s not THAT noticeable, it’s reasonable for a renewed phone :) very happy!"
"I purchased this iPhone 11 and paid extra for ""excellent"" condition.  It looks brand new with no scratches or any other surface imperfections. It came with 91% battery health.  I gave it 4 stars because the display screen was replaced with a non-Apple part (the Apple alert is permanently showing in ""Settings"" due to the non-Apple replacement part.)  The screen works well but it is VERY sensitive.  It responds by just hovering my finger over the screen without touching it.  The charging cord lay on top of the phone while I wasn't using it and I noticed the screen was going crazy until I moved the cord of the screen.  All in all, I think this is a great bargain.  The phone works well.  I understand that with refurbished electronics, there are no expectations of a brand new functioning item.  With that in mind, I would recommend this phone.Update:  Once I got the phone in a case and added a screen protector, the display acts normally and is no longer ultra-sensitive.  The alert is still showing up and will probably be there permanently (showing up on Settings).  Otherwise, everything is working great."
"I needed to upgrade to a newer phone. Mine stopped charging. I looked at getting a new phone and the price was more than what I wanted to pay. After looking at the different options I went with the iPhone 11. I received it the next day(that was fast) opened the box up and it looked like a brand new phone. It came with a screen protector a case and a wall plug and wire. I am impressed, now the condition of the phone. It’s in excellent condition no scratches on the screen just a little scratch on the bottom edge of the phone in what you won’t see with a case on . The battery health is at 100% was very happy to see that. Overall I would buy a phone from this seller again in the future very happy with the fast service and a phone in excellent condition"
"The I*Phone 11 I purchased is fully functioning with 256 GB of memory. I paid for the ""Excellent"" refurbished phone which was advertised not to have any scratches/ marks visible within 12"". The phone I recevied had a deep, easily visible 3/4"" scratch on the top of the case. A fingernail easily caught in the scratch. The remainder of the phone and especially the cameras and screen were perfect.The battery health was advertised as 80% or better so I was hoping for better. Unfortunately it arrived at 80% battery health and after the first day's use and full charge, the battery health dropped to 79%.A phone case and glass screen protector were included with the phone which was a nice surprise. It is good for initial use but I already had a much better case to protect this investment.I paid up for an ""Excellent"" refurb phone and next time I would only pay for a ""Good"" quality. I hope the battery health holds up since I paid up for the 256 GB of internal memory and wanted to use this phone for a couple of years."

"The phone shipped to me did not meet the Amazon renewed standard of having at least 80% battery function (it was slightly below at 77%). I contacted the seller and was given several options for remediation. I could return it for refund, return it for replacement, or take it to an Apple Store or Best Buy for battery replacement. I opted to get the battery replaced at Best Buy and sent the seller a copy of my receipt and they refunded the cost (including sales tax) to my credit card. I was amazed at how hassle-free it was and am thrilled to have a brand new battery to boot. The phone itself is in pristine condition and has no issues."

"It’s great and runs great! battery capacity was up to 97%, the iphone itself was up to date. No scratches on screen or cracks. BUT there was a few small dents in the paint around the phone & the phone keeps showing messages saying “unauthorized apple product” meaning there definitely is some aftermarket parts in it. For what it is, It’s a great deal! im satisfied."
